## Overview

Incipit is a full stack web app that lets you discover books through a swipe-based interface. Pick your genres, swipe right on books you want to read, and build a personal shelf over time. Built with a modern TypeScript stack and deployed on Vercel.

## Features

- **Swipe interface** — drag cards left to pass, right to save. LIKE/PASS indicators animate as you drag.
- **Genre-based feed** — picks genres during onboarding, feed rotates through them automatically.
- **Personal shelf** — all your saved books in one place, with the ability to remove any title.
- **Duplicate prevention** — books you've already swiped never appear again.
- **Auth** — sign up and sign in via Clerk with email or Google.

## Roadmap

### In Progress
- [x] Deploy to Vercel

### Planned
- [ ] **AI recommendations** — Claude API generates a personalised "why you'd like this" blurb based on swipe history
- [ ] **Shelf filters** — filter saved books by genre, rating, or date added
- [x] **Onboarding redirect** — detect new users and route them to onboarding before the feed
- [ ] **Reading status** — mark books as "want to read", "reading", or "finished"
- [x] **Book detail modal** — tap a card to expand full description, page count, and publication info

### Future Ideas
- [ ] **Friends & social** — follow friends, see what they're reading
- [ ] **Weekly picks** — curated stack of 10 books refreshed every Monday
- [ ] **Export shelf** — download your shelf as a CSV or sync to Goodreads
- [ ] **PWA support** — install as a mobile app
